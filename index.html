  <h2>The Western ITE SLS 2026 @ UCI site is currently under maintenance.</h2>
  <p>The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) student chapter at UC Irvine is set to host the 2026 ITE Western District’s Annual Student Leadership Summit (SLS), a 3-day event with an expected attendance of more than 300 students and industry professionals. From January 23rd through 25th, 2026, attendees will take part in field-trips, workshops, a gala-style banquet, a career fair, networking, and much more. This event is a valuable opportunity for students to broaden their industry knowledge in various transportation fields and build their network with industry professionals and student peers. Attendees will enjoy locally-catered meals that showcase Orange County’s diverse and vibrant food scene.</p>
  <p>SLS brings together students and professionals from all over the Western District (encompassing ITE members from California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and more), each with their unique experiences that have developed their enthusiasm for transportation. During the Summit, students and professionals will have the chance to connect, forming life-long collaborations and professional partnerships.</p>
  <p>Students and industry professionals – whether in engineering, planning, management, data analytics, or whatever else – are welcome to join us for SLS.</p>
  <p>We are currently renovating our website with a planned launch in November. Please stay tuned!<br/><br/>
